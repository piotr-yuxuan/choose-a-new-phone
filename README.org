#+TITLE: choose-a-new-phone

A simple [[https://github.com/Day8/re-frame][re-frame]] application designed to help you choose the most
recent LineageOS phone with the latest android version.

This is a pet project I use to exercice myself to design and code with
style. This is an on-going work.

Apart from this educational side, we can find quite a few buzzwords to
describe this project:

- *Reactive programming* thanks to re-frame. Data are rendered only
  when changed. Change flow is unidirectional so no loop can happen.
- *Functional* programming so it uses Clojure functions which are
  pure.
- *Edge computing* because the long-term goal is to have all the work
  done by clients. Server or Cloud functions (Ã  la Amazon Lambda)
  simply shouln't need to exist at all.
- *Isomorphic* because most of the code logic (apart from rendering)
  can be executed seamlessly in Clojure runtime in the JVM or in
  ClojureScript runtime in JavaScript environment.
- *Dehydrated data* because each client embeds reasonably up-to-date
  data which are refreshed on start in order to improve time to first
  rendering.
- *Server-rendering* but actually there isn't anything like a server
  here, so compile-time-rendering. The loaded page actually is already
  a reasonably up to date rendering of the script and shouldn't change
  that much over time.
